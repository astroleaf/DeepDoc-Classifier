Project Overview
This project presents a production-ready deep learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline developed during an AI/ML internship at YBI Foundation. The pipeline processes and classifies large-scale textual data with over 500,000 documents, achieving a high accuracy of 94%. The key innovations include:

Robust Preprocessing Pipeline: Advanced text cleaning, normalization, stopword removal, and tokenization to produce high-quality inputs for training.

Hybrid Model Architecture: Leveraging a Bidirectional LSTM combined with BERT embeddings in an ensemble framework to boost classification performance.

Performance Optimization: Training speed enhanced by 30% through mixed precision and gradient accumulation. Low latency inference with Dockerized Flask API serving 10,000+ daily requests under 150ms response times with 99.9% uptime.

Scalable Deployment: Fully Dockerized microservice architecture including Redis caching and Nginx load balancing, enabling smooth production usage.

Comprehensive Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation with multi-metric scoring, error analysis, and class imbalance handling.

Extensive Testing: Unit and integration tests across preprocessing, modeling, and API components verify robustness and reliability.

Features
Preprocessing: Text cleaning, lemmatization, TF-IDF extraction

Models: BiLSTM, BERT classifier, Ensemble
